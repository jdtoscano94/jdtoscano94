Hi, I’m Juan Diego Toscano!
I am from Ecuador, and I will be starting my Engineering, Ph.D. - Fluids and Thermal Sciences program at Brown University next fall. I’m interested in Scientific Machine Learning, so I’m currently studyin PINNs and DeepOnets.

For the last two years, I have had the chance to participate in several projects related to Advanced Manufacturing Process Modeling and unsupervised learning for point cloud processing with the University at Buffalo. I plan to upload those codes to GitHub soon!

If you have any questions or if I can help you in some way, please feel free to reach me at: juan_toscano@brown.edu.
