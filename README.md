Hi, I’m Juan Diego Toscano!
I am a Ph.D. student at Brown University in the Engineering- Fluids and Thermal Sciences program. My research focuses on Scientific Machine Learning for data-driven discovery.

A few years ago, I participated in several research projects about Advanced Manufacturing Process Modeling and unsupervised learning for shape reconstruction with the University at Buffalo. I plan to upload those codes to GitHub soon!

If you have any questions or if I can help you in some way, please feel free to reach me at: juan_toscano@brown.edu.
