Hi, thanks for stopping by!
I am a Ph.D. student in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University. I earned my Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering from the Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE in Ecuador. My research journey began as an undergraduate when I collaborated remotely with the University at Buffalo on several projects, exploring machine learning modeling of physical systems. Since 2022, I have been working under the mentorship of Prof. George Karniadakis, delving into the realm of scientific machine learning (SciML).

My research focuses on obtaining reliable and stable machine learning methods to study and understand complex physical systems that cannot be analyzed using traditional methods (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid). To this end, I am currently developing optimization methods for physics-informed neural networks and artificial intelligence velocimetry (AIV).
